# nRF52840-Clone-Hero-Controller
This is a custom BLE enabled clone hero (or other rythm game) controller built around a xiao nRF52840 board.
I played Lego Rock Band on the wii as a kid, and recently discovered clone hero as an alternative that allows you to play custom songs, make your own charts, and can run on a potato. However, the cheap wii controllers I had were annoying to use with their membrane switches, chunky usb reciever, and unweildy size. This motivated me to build a custom guitar controller with mechanical switches, ble for battery life, and a body of my own design.
